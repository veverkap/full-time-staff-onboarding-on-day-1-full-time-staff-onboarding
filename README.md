The day is finally here! You might be at a WeWork location, at our Flatiron School HQ, or even sitting at your desk at home. But regardless, you're here and we're so pumped that its Monday! In WeWork speak #TGIM (Thank god its Monday!)

Today is going to be awesome, excilerating, and encouraging. Today may also be hectic, confusing, and a bit overwhelming. All of these reactions are normal and I encourage you to feel all of them when needed. There is nothing that we can't solve together - even if it takes just a bit more time than expected :)

Here's what's going on today: 

**WeWork Tech Orientation:** WeWork services our technology needs and that includes computers, chargers, adapters, and keycards. For those participating in orientation onsite, you will be provided with your computer on day 1. For our remote team, you will recieve your computer via FedEx (ideally by day 1, but possibly later in which you'll use your personal device in the interim - Sarah will communicate expectations on a case by case basis) and do tech orientation on day 2. You will obtain a keycard by going into your nearest WeWork location (or picking one up when you are visiting somewhere that has a WeWork nearby).  For both groups, during this orientation, you will be provisioned on OneLogin, WeWork's single sign-on, and gain access to a myriad of techological resources powered by WeWork. We'll go into more of what each of these includes in the WeWork Systems lesson. 

**Benefits Orientation:** WeWork also provides our FT employees with benefits (medical, dental, vision, transportion, 401k, etc.) For those participating in orientation onsite, you will hear from the benefits team about what you can expect in terms of offerings, sign up, and timeline. For our remote team, you will recieve this information on day 2.

**Flatiron Orientation**: While we have historically led Flatiron-specific orientations, by utilizing this track to the fullest extent you can find all of the information you need. Rather, Sarah will provide you with any assistance you need beyond what is provided in the Flatiron Systems lesson.
