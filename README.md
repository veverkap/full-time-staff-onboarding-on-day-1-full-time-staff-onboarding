The day is finally here! You might be at a WeWork location, at our Flatiron School HQ, or even sitting at your desk at home. But regardless, you're here and we're so pumped that its Monday! In WeWork speak #TGIM (Thank god its Monday!)

Today is going to be awesome, excilerating, and encouraging. Today may also be hectic, confusing, and a bit overwhelming. All of these reactions are normal and I encourage you to feel all of them when needed. There is nothing that we can't solve together - even if it takes just a bit more time than expected :)
